# Task Manager App

## Project overview
### What? 
This is a personal JavaScript learning project.

### Why? 
My ultimate purpose when switching to become a developer is to build my own website, to make my ideas come true. Therefore, web technologies are what I aim to.
This personal project is the first demo application that I have committed myself to, aiming to build a real app and solve a real-world problem. Though initially it may not meet expectations but I will improve it gradually.

#### Project goals?
This project aims to:
1. Target at a specific product: clone **Jira** kanban feature.
2. Enhance **JavaScript** and programming technical skills.
